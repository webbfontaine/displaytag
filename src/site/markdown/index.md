Display tag library 2.0
-----------------------

This documentation is related to the displaytag **2.0** release
([changelog](changes-report.html)).

### Overview

The display tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that
provide high-level web presentation patterns which will work in an MVC
model. The library provides a significant amount of functionality while
still being easy to use.

### What can I do with it?

Actually the display tag library can just... display tables! Give it a
list of objects and it will handle column display, sorting, paging,
cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of a table
in a customizable XHTML style.

The tables in the sample images below were generated from lists using
the `<display:table>` tag:
